If they choose to enter, they encounter a variety of gruesome sights such as mangled, decomposing corpses strewn about the place. When they try to leave, they realize that the entrance was under the effect of some sort of magic, and now is unable to open even with extreme force. Suddenly, strange noises can be heard echoing from somewhere else in the lair."
